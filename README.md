# Forage-QuantResearch

This repository is the response to Forage's JPMorgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research job simulation. There are 4 tasks in this simulation as detailed below:
1. Investigate and analyze price data: Write code that analyzes data to take a date as input and return a price for past and future estimates
2. Price a commodity storage contract: Create a prototype pricing model that can go through further validation and testing before being put into production
3. Credit risk analysis: Build a model using Python that will estimate the probability of default for a borrower
4. Bucket FICO scores: Deploy detailed Python code to strategically bucket customers with various FICO scores in order to narrow in on the probability of default
